/*
 * Class: CMSC203 
 * Instructor: Grigoriy Grinberg
 * Description: This program will generate a random number from 0-99 and the user gets an infinite amount of tries to correctly guess the random number.
 * Due: 9/27/2021
 * Platform/compiler: Eclipse
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
   I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
   I have not given my code to any student.
